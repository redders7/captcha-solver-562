# Captcha Solver
In this project, we are delving into optical character recognition (OCR) by leveraging a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) dataset. This dataset comprises of images featuring a combination of five alphanumeric characters, presenting a challenging problem for machine learning algorithms. While the dataset only contains images, the image file name serves as the target label for the respective image. 

The images within the dataset have undergone some transformation by applying noise, specifically blur and a linear overlay. These distortions hopes to simulate real-world challenges encountered in deciphering distorted and obscured characters, thus increasing the complexity of the task at hand. Each image is formatted as a 200 x 50 pixel PNG file. There is also a spatial considerations to consider given the spread of the 5 alphanumeric characters in the given space which further contributes to the intricacies of the OCR process.

Our primary motivation is to critically examine the efficacy of CAPTCHA as a robust deterrent against automated bots. The underlying premise is to scrutinize the fundamental assumption that CAPTCHA, in its current form, provides an effective differentiator between human users and automated scripts. The project explores the potential limitations and susceptibilities of CAPTCHA, in hopes of understanding the extent to which emerging machine learning techniques can subvert its intended purpose.

In undertaking this endeavor, we contribute to the broader discourse on digital security by shedding light on the need for more robust and adaptive methods to safeguard online platforms. This investigation addresses the pragmatic considerations surrounding the evolution of security measures in the face of advancing technological capabilities. The ultimate goal is to inform and guide the ongoing evolution of bot detections.

The project was completed as part of COMP562: Machine Learning at the University of North Carolina.
